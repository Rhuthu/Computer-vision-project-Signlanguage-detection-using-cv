# Computer-vision-project-Signlanguage-detection-using-cv
s7 
# Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking.
- Automatic cropping and standardization of hand sign images.
- ASL sign classification using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Utilizes Google's Teachable Machine for model training.
- Supports custom dataset creation for further model improvement.
- Easily extensible for future enhancements and applications.

  ## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone library
- Google's Teachable Machine

1. Clone the repository 
2. Install the required Python packages
 ### Image Data Collection (datacollection.py)
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the `datacollection.py` script to capture images of ASL signs
3. The script will open your webcam, and you can capture images by pressing the 's' key.
4. Captured images will be saved in the `Data/f` folder for creating a dataset.
   ## Dataset Creation
To train the ASL sign recognition model, you can use Google's Teachable Machine or other machine learning platforms. You will need to:
1. Create a labeled dataset using the images captured using `datacollection.py`.
2. Train the model with the dataset using your preferred machine learning platform.
3. Save the trained model to a file (e.g., `keras_model.h5`) and generate a labels file (e.g., `labels.txt`).

## Customization
You can customize the project for your specific requirements by modifying the code and configuration.
## Real-Time Sign Detection (test.py)
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the `test.py` script to initiate real-time ASL sign detection:
3. The application will access your webcam and display the camera feed.
4. Show ASL signs in front of your camera, and the detected sign will be displayed on the screen.
